<h3>Mushoku Tensei</h3>

<p>AMAZING fantasy world with rich history. 
It takes time in each location and gives each of their unique and diverse cultures their 
due attention so you can fully appreciate everything. </p>

<p>The characters in the cast are each lovable in their own with certain quirks and personalites, 
this does not mean the characters are one-dimensional, on the contrary, each of them have their own 
unique issues and shortcoming they have to deal with in a believable and human way.</p>

<p>The series follows, instead of the typical "defeat the demon lord" troupe, a NEET who made nothing of his previous life,
spent just mooching off his parents, so he doesn't have to spend time working and interacting with others,
so he can just waste away in his room, jacking off and playing dating SiMs. At the end of his life, he feels nothing but regret,
and so, he is given a second chance at life to make meaningful relationships and overcome his personal trauma.</p>

<h3>Kingdom (Manga)</h3>
<img src = "../assets/images/kingdom.jpg" height = "200"/>

<p>A historical Epic following the real (albeit romantacized) history behind the formation of the Qin dynasty of Ancient China.
The story follows a boy who was orphaned by the many wars fought by the 7 warring states. The boy has dreams of becoming "The Greatest General under the Heavens"
and through a twist of fate, is in the presence of one of the future kings. This story realy high octane from the get-go.
The battles are the main junction of the story. Each battle is depicted with pain-staking detail, and the people are participating are all with their own baggage and depth. 
The fights and backgrounds are drawn with as much detail as the fights themselves.
This is one of the most detailed and grandest depicition of warfare in any medium.</p>

<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>

<p>If you don't know the ending is flawless and concludes one of the greatest stories ever told, you were dropped on the head when you were a child.</p>
